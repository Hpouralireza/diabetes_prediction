# diabetes_prediction
Diabetes is a disease that can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and heart attacks, as well as death. Because of that we can use Machine learning to prevent the death by making an artificial intelligent model and the method that be used is comparison between the KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms to see which algorithm suit the best for diabetes prediction. The dataset that used in this project is available on Kaggle. According to the results of our evaluating alghorithm with using Confusion Matrix, the Naive Bayes algorithm outperforms KNN.
